# DNS authoritative-zone drift incident containment

Act as the security operations engineer responding to a failed DNS zone-failover rollout. The failover automation left persistence and escalation paths on the resolver host: a rogue automation key in root's `authorized_keys`, a passwordless sudoers drop-in, and a world-readable TSIG zone-transfer key. First contain the host to match `/app/docs/containment_runbook.md` — revoke the automation's SSH persistence, remove its privilege escalation, and lock down the exposed key.

Then restore `/app/workflow/export_report.py`, the control-plane reconciler that converts authoritative-zone drift alerts into responder containment work. Preserve its operational CLI: `--input PATH` and `--output-dir PATH`, defaulting to `/app/data/events.json` and `/app/output`.

This is security-control reconciliation, not application feature development. The resulting artifacts decide which zone drifts require immediate containment, which are attenuated by approved policy windows, and how risk carries between repeated drifts in the same environment.

Always read freezes and scoped attenuation policies from their fixed absolute paths:
`/app/data/change_freezes.json`, `/app/data/reopen_windows.json`, `/app/data/rotation_windows.json`, `/app/data/defer_windows.json`, and `/app/data/zone_delegation_edges.json`. `--input` changes only the event stream; policy files never become relative to input/output directories.

`/app/docs/report_spec.json` is the output contract: file paths, schemas, required fields, repair tokens, digest payloads, and byte-level checksum serialization. Match it exactly.

How the reconciler actually behaves is not in the contract — canonicalization, deduplication, window merging, the freeze/reopen/rotation/defer attenuation layers and their scope rules, probe scoring, the sequential risk ledger, zone delegation traversal, queue admission, priority, and ordering all got settled by the failover governance board, and `/app/incident/failover_review_log.md` is where that record lives. It's long, most of it is routine noise, and the February failover drafts were revisited later and partly reversed — several March interim positions were revised again in May — so read it as a decision record that resolves over time rather than a list of facts each individually true, and follow the latest decision on every point. Every value you emit has to be derived from the operational inputs, and the reconciler must keep working when pointed at a different alert stream.

Write exactly `summary.json`, `drift_windows.json`, and compact `response_queue.jsonl` under the requested output directory. These are security evidence and responder-queue artifacts: they must generalize to alternate alert streams, remain idempotent across reruns, and derive only from operational sources. Keep the frozen incident snapshot `/app/workflow/.export_report.original` unchanged and never read/import verifier artifacts.
